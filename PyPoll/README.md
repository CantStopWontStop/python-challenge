# PyPoll

This projects analyzes the result of an election. 

## Setup

The main analysis was done in Python with Pandas using VS Code as the IDE.

The analysis was duplicated in Quarto Markdown file and paired with an equivalent analysis in R with tidyverse using RStudio as the IDE. In order to be able to use Python and Pandas in RStudio, the reticulate package was used.  


## Output
The output of the main analysis prints to the console as well as generates a text file with the results.

Rendering the Quarto Markdown file generates and interactive html file to compare the both Python and R results and the respective code used to obtain them.
