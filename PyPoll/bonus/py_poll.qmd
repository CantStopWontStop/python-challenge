## Python

```{python}

import pandas as pd
import os


path = "../resources/election_data.csv"

election_data_raw = pd.read_csv(path)

election_results = election_data_raw.groupby("Candidate").agg(
    Votes = ('Ballot ID','count')
)

election_results['Prcent'] = election_results['Votes']/len(election_data_raw) * 100


winner = election_results[election_results['Votes'] == election_results['Votes'].max()]


print(f'There were {len(election_data_raw):,} ballots cast in this election.' + "\n" + "\n" +
f'{election_results}' + "\n" + "\n" + f'The winner is {winner.index[0]}.')
```

## R

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(reticulate)
library(glue)
library(gt)


election_data_raw <- read_csv('../resources/election_data.csv')

num_of_votes <- tally(election_data_raw) |> 
    pull(n) |> 
    format(big.mark = ",")



election_results <- election_data_raw |>  
    group_by(Candidate) |> 
    tally() |> 
    arrange(desc(n)) |> 
    rename(Votes = n) |> 
    ungroup() 

election_results_tbl <- election_results |> 
    mutate(Percent = (Votes/sum(Votes) * 100) |>
               formatC(format = "f", 
                       digits = 1),
           Votes = format(Votes, big.mark = ","),
           Votes = glue('{Percent}% ({str_trim(Votes)})')) |>
    select(-Percent) |> 
    gt()
    


winner <- election_results |>
    filter( Votes == max(Votes)) |> 
    pull(Candidate)
```

There were `r num_of_votes` ballots cast in the election.

`r election_results_tbl`

The winner of the election is `r winner`.
